# Abstract
With the recent advances in deep neural networks, several experiments involved
the generalist-specialist paradigm for classification. However, until now no
formal study compared the
performance of different clustering algorithms for class assignment. In this
paper we perform such a study, suggest slight modifications to the clustering
procedures, and propose a novel algorithm designed to optimize the performance of 
of the specialist-generalist classification system. Our experiments on the
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets allow us to investigate situations for varying
number of classes similar similar data.


# Introduction
Designing an efficient classification system using deep neural networks is a
complicated one, which often use a multitude of models arranged in ensembles.
(Dieleman & al. 2015, Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) Those ensembles often lead to state-of-the-art
results on a wide range of different tasks such as image classification (Szegedy
& al. 2014), speech recognition (Hannun & al. 2014), and machine translation.
(Sutskever & al. 2014) Those ensembles are trained independently and in parallel, and different
techniques can be used to merge their predictions.

An more structured alternative to ensembling is the use of the
specialist-generalist framework. As described by Bochereau & Bourgine (1990), a
natural analogy can be rises from the medical field; a patient first consults a
general practitioner which provides an initial diagnosis which is then refined
by one or several specialists. In the case of classification, the practitioners
are replaced by neural networks and the final prediction is a combination of
the specialists, and may or may not include the generalist's output.

In recent years, generalist and specialists have been studied under
different circumstances. In particular Hinton & al. (2014) used specialists
to create an efficient image classifier for a large private dataset. The final
predictions of the specialists were then used to train a reduced classifier
that achieved performance similar to the whole ensemble. Kahou & al. (2015)
describe a multimodal approach for emotion recognition in videos, based on
specialists. Maybe closer to our work, Warde-Farley & al. (2015) added
"auxiliary heads" (acting as specialists) to their baseline network, using the
precomputed features for both classification and clustering. They also
underlined one of the main advantages of using specialists; a relatively low
(and parallelizable) additional computational cost for increased performance.

# Clustering Algorithms
In order to assign classes to the specialists networks, we compare several
clustering algorithms on the confusion matrix of the outputs of the generalist.
This confusion matrix is computed on a held-out partition of the dataset.
Following previous works, we started by considering two baseline clustering
algorithms, namely Lloyd's K-Means algorithm and
Spectral clustering, according to the formulation of [Ng & al. (2002)]. In
addition to those baseline algorithms, we evaluate the performance of two novel
procedures specifically designed to improve the generalist-specialist paradigm.
Those algorithms are described in the following paragraphs, and pseudo code is
given in [Figures TODO].

We also experiment with different was of building a confusion matrix. Besides
the usual way (denoted here as _standard_) we tried three alternatives:

*   _soft sum_: for each prediction, we  use the raw model output instead of
    the one-hot multi-class output,
*   _soft sum pred_: just like *soft sum*, but only add the prediction output to the
    confusion matrix, if the class was correctly predicted,
*   *soft sum not pred*: similarly to *soft sum pred*, but only if the
    prediction output was incorrectly predicted.

As discussed in later sections, the influence of the confusion matrix is
minimal. Nonetheless we include them for completeness purposes.

Both of our clustering algorithms further modify the confusion matrix $A$ by
computing $CM = \textbf{A}^\top + \textbf{A}$, which symmetrizes the matrix. We
define the entries of the matrix to be the *animosity score* between two
classes; given classes *a* and *b*, their animosity score is found at $CM_{a,
b}$. We then initialize each cluster with non-overlapping pairs of classes
yielding maximal animosity score. We then greedily select the next classes to
be added to the clusters, according to the following rules:

*   In the case of *greedy single* clustering, a single class maximizing the
    overall animosity score is added to the cluster yielding the largest
    averaged sum of animosity towards this class. This partitions the classes
    in clusters, building on the intuition that classes that are hard to
    distinguish should be put together.

*   In the case of *greedy pair* clustering, we follow the same strategy as in
    *greedy single* clustering but act on pair of classes instead of single
    classes. In this case we allow the clusters to share elements, and thus
    specialists can ahve overlapping jdugements.

This process is repeated until all classes have been assigned to at least one
cluster.

<!--1 par: describe greedy singles and greedy pairs.-->

# Experiments
We investigate the performance of the aforementioned algorithms on the CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 datasets [(Krizhevsky & al, 2009)]. Both datasets contain similar
images, partitioned in 45'000 train, 5'000 validation, and 10'000 test images.
They contain 10 and 100 classes respectively. For both experiments we train the
generalist network on the train set only, and use the validation set for
clustering purposes. As we are interested in the clustering performance we did
not augment nor pre-process the images. Note that when trained on the
horizontally flipped training and validation set our baseline algorithm
reaches 10.18% and 32.22% misclassification error, which is competitive with
the current state-of-the-art presented in [Springenberg & al, 2015]. [^1]

[^1]: The code for those experiments, is
freely available online at [github.com/seba-1511/specialists](http://www.github.com/seba-1511/specialists).

Following [Courbariaux & al, 2015], the baseline network is based on the
conclusions of [Simonyan & al, 2015] and uses three pairs of batch-normalized
convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer, and two
fully-connected layers. The same model is used for specialists, whose weights
are initialized with the trained weights of the generalist. One major departure
from the work of [Hinton dark knowledge] is that our specialists are predicting
over the same classes as the generalist, ie given a cluster we do not merge all
classes outside of the cluster into a unique one. With regards to the
generalist, the specialist is only biased towards a subset of the classes,
since it has been fine-tuned to perform well on those ones.

## CIFAR-10
<!--TODO: Write this section with updated results.-->

For CIFAR-10 experiments, we considered up to five clusters, and all of the
possible combinations of confusion matrix and clustering algorithms. The results
for this experiments are reported in Table 1.

<!--Point out interesting results don't mention ineficacity of small training set.
Say that for small amount of classes, specialists seem useless, and other
techniques (algorithmic ?) should be considered.-->

Interestingly, the choice of confusion matrix has
only a limited impact on the overall performance, indicating that the enphasis
should be put on the choice of the clustering algorithm. We notice that
clustering with greedy pairs consistantly yields better scores. However none of
the spcialist experiments are able to improve on the baseline, indicating that
specialists might not be as efficient when dealing with a small number of
classes.

## CIFAR-100

<!--TODO: Write this section with updated results.-->

For CIFAR-100 we performed the exact same experiment as for CIFAR-10 but
considered using more specialists, the largest experiments involving 28
clusters. The results are shown in Table 2.

<!--Table of results
Discuss results, (cm useless, pairs better) nothing about poor performance vs
baseline, spec works better than cif10, 

greedy pairs: allows overlap, thus closer to an ensemble than traditional
specialists.
-->

Similarly to CIFAR-10, we observe that greedy pairs clustering outperforms the
other clustering techniques, and that the different types of confusion matrix
have a limited influence on the final score. We also notice that fewer clusters
work better than a lot of them. Finally and unlike the results for CIFAR-10,
some of the specialists are able to improve upon the generalist, which confirms
our intuition that specialists work better when a large number of output classes
is involved.

Our explanation for the improved performance of greedy pairs is the following. Allowing
clusters to overlap leads to the assignment of difficult classes
to multiple specialists. At inference time, this means that more networks will
influence the final prediction which is analogous to building a larger ensemble
for difficult classes.

# Conclusion and Futur Work
<!--
Larger dataset (as in Hinton Dark Knowledge and self informed or imagenet)
would lead to better results, because we can afford to take images without
hurting the train score. 

Interesting how some specialists are only biased, not exclusively trained.
Funny that this and overlapping works better than exclusive.

Add that normalizing would only help if the train distribution is different than test distribution
-->

We introduced a novel clustering algorithm for the specialist-generalist
framework, which is able to consistantly outperform other techniques on the same
task. We also provided a preliminary study of the different factors coming into
play when dealing with specialists, and concluded that the choice of confusion
matrix from our proposed set only has little impact on the final classification
outcome.

Despite our encouraging results with clustering techniques, no one of our
specialists-based experiments came close to compete with the generalist model
trained on the entire train and validation set. This was a surprising outcome
and we suppose that this effect comes from the size of the datasets. In both
cases, 5'000 images corresponds to 10% of the original training set and removing
that many train examples has a drastic effect on both generalists and
specialists. All the more so since we are not using any kind of data
augmentation techniques, which could have moderated this downside. An obvious
futur step is to validate the presented ideas on a much larger dataset such as
Imagenet [IMAGENET citation] where splitting the train set would not hurt the
train score as much.
